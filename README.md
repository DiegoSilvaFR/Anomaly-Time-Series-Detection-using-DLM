# Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) for Anomaly Detection using PyKALM
This repository contains code for implementing a Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) for anomaly detection using PyKALM, a Python package for state-space modeling and Kalman filtering. The model is trained and evaluated on the Yahoo Anomaly Dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset for anomaly detection research.

# Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a dynamic linear model using PyKALM for detecting anomalies in time-series data. The PyKALM package provides powerful tools for state-space modeling, which can be leveraged to capture temporal dependencies in the data and detect anomalies accurately.

# Dataset
The Yahoo Anomaly Dataset used in this project is a publicly available dataset that contains time-series data with known anomaly labels. It includes various types of time-series data, such as system metrics, network traffic, and server logs, making it suitable for evaluating the performance of the DLM model in different domains.

# Model Training 
The PyKALM model is trained on the labeled data from the Yahoo Anomaly Dataset. The model learns to capture the temporal dependencies in the data and identifies patterns associated with normal behavior.
